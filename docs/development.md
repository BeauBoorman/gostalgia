# Development

## Build and check

```sh
go build ./...        # compile everything
go vet ./...          # static analysis
gofmt -l .            # formatting check (empty output = clean)
go test ./...         # unit + integration tests
go test -race ./...   # race detector (run before merging anything)
```

Or `make build|vet|fmt|test|race`. Requires Go ≥ 1.25 (`os.Root.MkdirAll`).

## Run the environment

```sh
go run ./cmd/gostalgia boot --root /tmp/gs        # terminal 1
go run ./cmd/gctl --root /tmp/gs status        # terminal 2
```

Default root is `~/.gostalgia` (or `$GOSTALGIA_ROOT`). `gctl` commands:
`status`, `ps`, `apps`, `echo MSG`, `ls PATH`, `cat PATH`, `shutdown`, and
`call METHOD [JSON]` for any IPC method.

A full walkthrough:

```sh
gostalgia boot --root /tmp/gs &
gctl --root /tmp/gs echo hello           # → hello (echo #1)
gctl --root /tmp/gs apps                 # echo listed as running
gctl --root /tmp/gs ls /users/guest      # seeded user directories
gctl --root /tmp/gs shutdown             # clean shutdown
```

Shut down with Ctrl-C in the boot terminal instead, if you prefer; both paths
run the same graceful shutdown.

## Repository layout

```text
cmd/gostalgia        environment runtime binary
cmd/gctl          control CLI for a running environment
internal/          config, events, ipc, vfs, process, session, security,
                   service (framework), services (core services), app,
                   runtime
apps/              builtin applications: echo/ plus registration and
                   manifest seeding (apps.go)
platform/          host-specific listeners/dialers (build tags)
test/e2e           boots a real environment and exercises it over a socket
docs/              architecture + subsystem documents
status.md          living status + the canonical backlog list
```

## Conventions

- Zero external dependencies; stdlib only. Justify any new `require` in the
  PR and in docs/architecture.md §4.
- No `GOOS` conditionals outside `platform/`.
- Every subsystem ships with tests; new IPC methods need a capability decision
  (docs/security.md) and a test covering the deny path.
- Errors are wrapped with `%w` and prefixed by the subsystem (`ipc:`, `vfs:`,
  `process:`); messages must not leak host paths.
- Documents under `docs/` are kept in sync with the implementation; a PR that
  changes behavior updates the matching document.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs vet, tests, and (on unix) `-race` on
ubuntu/macos/windows matrix runners, plus a `gofmt` check.
