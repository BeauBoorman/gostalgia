# Gostalgia Status

The living status document: what works right now, how it is verified, what is
honestly missing, and the itemized milestone list. This is the **canonical
tracker** — `docs/architecture.md` §5 summarizes the milestone arc and points
here.

> **Workflow note:** Daily task dispatch, issue progress, and parallel agent
> workflows are tracked natively on GitHub (issues, milestones, and pull
> requests with `Fixes #XX`). To prevent git merge conflicts and serialization
> bottlenecks across parallel agents, **feature PRs do not edit `status.md`**.
> This document is reconciled on `main` at milestone completions or periodic
> project syncs.

Rules for updating this file (milestone syncs):

1. An item moves to ✅ only when it **boots and runs**, passes
   `go vet ./...` and `go test -race ./...`, and its documentation in `docs/`
   is updated to match reality.
2. The "Snapshot" section describes what a user can actually do today — not
   what exists in code but is unexercised.
3. Known gaps stay listed until they are fixed; nothing is deleted to make a
   milestone look complete.

## Snapshot: what works today

| Capability | State | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Boot → services → session → app launch → IPC → clean shutdown | ✅ working | `test/e2e` (real socket, real auth, real shutdown) |
| Service framework (dep-ordered start, rollback, reverse stop) | ✅ working | `internal/service` unit tests |
| IPC: in-proc + socket transports, token handshake, NDJSON | ✅ working | `internal/ipc` tests + `gctl` manual/e2e |
| IPC: concurrent calls, versioned subscriptions, bounded metadata-only audit history | ✅ working | `internal/ipc` race stress (slow clients, floods, malformed frames, reconnect/epochs, permissions); `test/e2e` real runtime lifecycle notifications and secret/document redaction |
| Process model: in-proc lifecycle, child spawn/kill/exit-status, bounded output capture, diagnostics | ✅ working | `internal/process` tests (ring buffer, drop accounting, env sanitization); `proc/list`, `proc/info`, `proc/logs` over IPC; `gctl ps`/`logs` and shell `ps`/`logs` |
| Process supervision: restart policies, crash-loop backoff, bounded exit history, reaping | ✅ working | `internal/process` supervision tests (`StateRestarting`/`StateCrashLoop`, sliding-window restarts, exponential backoff) |
| VFS: safe doc ops, atomic save + recovery fallback, copy/move, trash/restore, host/memfs backends, mounts | ✅ working | unit tests + e2e + failure injection + fstest |
| App SDK: embedded JSON manifest, Init/Run/Stop, scoped calls/routes, launch/stop | ✅ working | `sdk`, `internal/app`, services + shell socket lifecycle tests |
| External Go apps over the environment protocol | ✅ working | `internal/app` wire tests; bounded child-wire frames, in-flight dispatch, and redirect-hop limits |
| Isolation levels (`inproc`/`trusted`/`sandbox`/`strict`) with fail-closed execution | ✅ working | `platform` adapters + `test/e2e` sandbox/adversarial tests: Linux user/net/mount namespaces + `prlimit64`, macOS Seatbelt via `sandbox-exec` (inherited-FD IPC, no unix-socket egress), Windows fails closed |
| Charm shell: DOS-style prompt, app shelf, history/completion, VFS/process commands | ✅ working | `internal/experience/shell` (real Bubble Tea + authenticated IPC) |
| Shell experience: home screen, searchable launcher, command palette | ✅ working | `internal/experience/shell` tests + golden files |
| Task Manager, notification center, crash receipts | ✅ working | `internal/experience/taskmanager`, `internal/experience/notifications`, `internal/experience/receipts` |
| Accessible terminal modes (monochrome, high-contrast) + layout regression coverage | ✅ working | `internal/experience/ui` golden tests |
| Visual language & component kit (tokens, panels, tabs, dialogs, badges) | ✅ working | `internal/experience/ui` + `internal/experience/theme` |
| Presentation contract: typed/versioned data+action elements, shell owns rendering (v2 adds text blocks, meters, grids) | ✅ working | `internal/app` presentation tests, shell presentation tests |
| Charm baseline & dependency fences: Bubble Tea v1.3.10, Lip Gloss v1.1.0, Bubbles v1.0.0 | ✅ working | `test/e2e` dependency fences (`TestCoreDependencyBoundary`, `TestCharmRestrictedToExperienceShell`, `TestApprovedCharmBaseline`, `TestNoStandaloneHostExecutables`) |
| Bundled apps: Echo, Files, Notes, Settings, Compendium, Calculator, Todo, Pomodoro, RSS, Weather, Sysmon, Markview, Adventure, Petwatch, Dogcalc, Musictoy | ✅ working | `apps/*` unit + acceptance tests (persistence, capability denial, corrupt-state healing, contract v1/v2 surfaces) |
| Event bus (typed synchronous handlers + bounded nonblocking metadata subscriptions/history) | ✅ working | `internal/events` tests, including ordered concurrent delivery, drop-oldest queues and 256-record retention |
| Config store: layered system/user/app precedence, live change events, atomic persist | ✅ working | `internal/config` layered + validation tests |
| Capability scoping: app Call/Handle adapters enforce manifest grants | ✅ working | SDK adapters replace caller grants; IPC methods reject unauthorized app calls; admin tokens remain trusted operator clients — see `docs/security.md` |
| Route-level capability enforcement (config, profile, session, document routes) | ✅ working | `config.read`/`profile.*`/`session.*`/`fs.write` enforced per-route; caller `app_id` pinned on config reads; stat oracle redacted |
| App identity & scoped grants: distinct per-app tokens, manifest capability grants, lifecycle revocation | ✅ working | `internal/security`, `internal/ipc`, `internal/app` unit + socket integration + `test/e2e` |

| Packages: safe install, update, rollback, permission inspection | ✅ working | `internal/pkg` manager/archive tests; `gctl package` |
| Recovery: portable backup, export/import, verified restore | ✅ working | `internal/recovery` tests; export omission reporting, hard-fail unreadable targets, profile-scoped restores |
| Platform opt-ins: clipboard, shared-folder mounts, network egress | ✅ working | `internal/security.PolicyStore` operator policies; sanitized clipboard, `os.Root`-confined host mounts, host/port/HTTPS egress filters |
| Cross-platform compile (darwin/linux/windows) | ✅ compiles | `GOOS=` builds in CI matrix |
| Cross-platform behavior: CI runs the full test suite on ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners | ✅ CI-green (Windows: full fstest skipped — see `docs/filesystem.md` metadata caveat; structural checks run everywhere) | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

Quick check from a clean checkout:

```sh
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test -race ./...
gofmt -l .  # empty output = clean
go run ./cmd/gostalgia shell --root /tmp/gs # interactive; exit shuts down
# Or headless:
go run ./cmd/gostalgia boot --root /tmp/gs   # terminal 1
go run ./cmd/gctl --root /tmp/gs status      # terminal 2
```

## Known gaps (honest list)

- **`inproc` apps share the runtime's memory.** In-process isolation is a
  logical capability boundary only — a rogue in-process component could bypass
  it via unsafe memory access. Untrusted applications must be packaged as
  external executables and run under `sandbox` or `strict` isolation
  (see `docs/security.md` §Isolation Levels).
- **Windows host confinement:** Windows lacks unprivileged native sandboxing
  equivalents to Linux user namespaces or macOS Seatbelt, so `sandbox`/`strict`
  requests **fail closed** by design; external apps on Windows run under
  `trusted` isolation only.
- **macOS Seatbelt is deprecated by Apple** (`sandbox-exec`/Sandbox.kext);
  it remains functional on standard macOS installs but future macOS versions
  may alter or remove it.
- **Network egress is kernel-enforced only for sandboxed external apps.**
  `inproc` and `trusted` apps use host networking; for them `net.egress` is a
  policy/capability gate, not a packet boundary.
- **Same-UID local attacker:** an attacker with code execution under the same
  OS user account can read `<root>/runtime.json`, attach debuggers, or inspect
  process memory. The operator token authenticates local clients; it is not a
  boundary against the owning OS account.
- **IPC observability is operator-only and metadata-only:** one subscription
  per connection; history retains 256 events in memory, not a durable security
  audit. Queue drops and runtime epochs explicitly signal resynchronization.
  Scoped app credentials do not grant access to the operator trail.
- **Linux `strict` descendant sweeping:** a descendant that both leaves the
  process group and orphans itself within one `/proc` poll interval can evade
  tracking until teardown, where `KillProcessTree` SIGKILLs the whole group
  (see `docs/security.md`).
- **Windows filesystem metadata:** directory mtimes are advisory on Windows
  (OS-level API inconsistency; see `docs/filesystem.md`).
- **VirelaiOS note:** Early VirelaiOS bring-up (toolchain, guest runner, kernel
  integration) is separately owned by the repository owner and is not treated as
  implemented; the shipped runtime remains standard-library Go on host platforms.
